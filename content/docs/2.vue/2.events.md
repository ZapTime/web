# Working with events

When using `externalBooking: true` inside config you handle your booking by yourself using helpful functions exported by the NPM package.

```vue
<template>
    <ZapTimeCalendar :config="config" />
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ZapTimeCalendar, IZapTimeConfig, book, reserve, confirm, cancel } from '@zaptime/vue3'

const config: IZapTimeConfig = {
  token: '<API_TOKEN>'
}


</script>

<style>
  @import url('/node_modules/@zaptime/vue3/dist/style.css');
</style>

```

## Book

When called event is immediately booked.
```ts
function book(email: string, firstName?: string, lastName?: string, seats?: number, calendarId?: string):Promise<void>;
```
## Reserve

When called event is reserved for 5 minutes. If confirmation doesn't take place, event is canceled automatically.
```ts
function reserve(email: string, firstName?: string, lastName?: string, seats?: number, calendarId?: string):Promise<void>;
```

## Confirm

When called previously reserved event is confirmed.

```ts
function confirm(calendarId?: string): Promise<void>;

```

## Cancel

```ts
function cancel(calendarId?: string): Promise<void>;

```
